# CustomCameraDemo

This is a barebones implementation on how to get a custom camera working using AVFoundation in iOS 10.

## Guide

1. Create a brand new Xcode project. Open up the `main.storyboard` file and add the following UI elements to the View Controller:

![storyboard](/images/storyboard.png)

1. This is a `UIView`. You will make this show whatever the iPhone camera is viewing.

2. This is a `UIImageView`. You will make this hold the image of the snapshot you take.

3. This is a `UIButton`. You will make this trigger the snapshot of the current camera's view.
